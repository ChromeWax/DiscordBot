# Discord bot
The bot allows users to manage the server. 
This includes switching what game server is running, running various scripts on the server, and playing music in voice chat.

# How to run this
The script assumes some game servers are on the computer. These can be swapped out for whatever servers you want to run.
* Add discord api token in config.json
* run 'npm install'
* run 'node main.js'
